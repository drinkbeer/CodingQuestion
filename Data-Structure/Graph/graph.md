Graph is a special Tree that (1) allows circle; (2) allows disconnection.

# Contents
Must understand:
+ [DFS]
+ [BFS]
+ [Topological Sort]

Highly-recommended:
Google really like Graph Theory related problems.
+ [Shorted/Minimal Path (Dijkstra, Bellman Ford, Floyd-Warshall)]
+ [Minimal Spanning Tree (Krusgal, Prim??)]
