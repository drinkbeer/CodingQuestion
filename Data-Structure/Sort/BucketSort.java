/**
 * Split elements into Buckets, and sort elements in Buckets using other sorting algorithms, finally merge the sorted buckets.
 * It is a "scatter-gather" approach, also can understand as MapReduce.
 *
 * Applications:
 * 1. input is uniformly distributed over a range (it can perform best if the values can be evenly distributed to buckets)
 * 2. there are floating point values
