Design a time-based task dispatcher.

## Using Java DelayQueue

#### Understand how Java DelayQueue works

```
public class DelayQueue<E extends Delayed> extends AbstractQueue<E>
    implements BlockingQueue<E> {

    private final transient ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private final PriorityQueue<E> q = new PriorityQueue<E>();

    /**
     * Thread designated to wait for the element at the head of
     * the queue.  This variant of the Leader-Follower pattern
     * (http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/POSA/POSA2/) serves to
     * minimize unnecessary timed waiting.  When a thread becomes
     * the leader, it waits only for the next delay to elapse, but
     * other threads await indefinitely.  The leader thread must
     * signal some other thread before returning from take() or
     * poll(...), unless some other thread becomes leader in the
     * interim.  Whenever the head of the queue is replaced with
     * an element with an earlier expiration time, the leader
     * field is invalidated by being reset to null, and some
     * waiting thread, but not necessarily the current leader, is
     * signalled.  So waiting threads must be prepared to acquire
     * and lose leadership while waiting.
     */
    private Thread leader;

    /**
     * Condition signalled when a newer element becomes available
     * at the head of the queue or a new thread may need to
     * become leader.
     */
    private final Condition available = lock.newCondition();
    
    /**
     * Inserts the specified element into this delay queue.
     *
     * @param e the element to add
     * @return {@code true}
     * @throws NullPointerException if the specified element is null
     */
