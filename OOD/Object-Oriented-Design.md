###4 steps to handle Object Oriented Deisign
1. Handle Ambiguity
    + Who is going to use it?
    + How are they goint to use it?
    + Where is it used?
    + When is it used?
    + Why is it used?
    + What is it?

2. Define the Core Objects
    + For example. we are designing a restaurant, core objects: Table, Guest, Party, Order, Meal, Employee, Server, and Host

3. Analyze Relations
    + Analyze the relationships between core objects, you perhaps need some assumptions, should communicate to interviewer
    + For example
        - Party has list of Guest
        - Server and Host inherit from Employee
        - Each Table belongs to one Party, but each Party has multiple Table
        - There is only one Host for the Resuaurant

4. Investigate Actions
    + Go through your design and check if you forgot somehting.
