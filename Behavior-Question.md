#####Myself
1. Introduce yourself  
I am now a Computer Science master in NCSU. I focused on Cloud Computing, Distributed System, High-Elastic backend development. In NCSU, I selected Algorithms, Operating System, Cloud Computing, Objected oriented Design and Development, etc. Before entering NCSU, I had 2.5 working experience in China. I was a Java developer. I hope to become a software engineer in AWS team, as Amazon is top 1 cloud service provier over the world.  

#####Projects
1. Most interesting project? Most challenging project?  
Refractoring Expertiza System is the most interesting project. Expertiza is an open source peer-review system for NCSU students. I wrote an unified interface for students and instructor's view page. And we created a new View Page Controller to simplify the complicate 3 layers hash data structure. It is an implementation of Facade Pattern. It's a good feeling that my code is used by thousands of NCSU students.  

2. What data structures did you use in your projects?  
Some HashMap, ArrayList, LinkedList.  

3. What design patterns did you use in your projects? Why you need it?  
Facade Pattern. It provides a simplified interface for our complicated 3 layers hash data structure. We made it easier to use with a new View Page Controller.  
Why need it? Because the original data structure is very complicated, it is constructed by many participant objects of a peer-review, for instance Review Controller, Score Controller, Question Controller, Feedback Controller, etc. So there are too many controllers for us to display even a single review, it's too difficult to use. So we write a new View Page Controller to connnect all these controllers. When we need to display, we use get the View Page Controller. It's much easier now.  

4. Give an example of the project you didn't finish?  
It's a project when I worked in Shanghai. I worked on my project based on Project Plan. When I finished most part of the project, customers came to our company, and said they need to modify the plan. I have to modify my work based on new plan. Finally I didn't finish the project on time. But my customers forgave us. 

5. Give an example of the project you did more than you expected?  
It's the Refractoring Expertiza System. We didn't expect the complicated 3 layers hash data structure. It's really complex because when we need to display a single peer-review page, we need to use many controllers, like Review Controller, Score Controller, Question Controller, Feedback Controller, and so on. We wrote a new View Page Controller to connect all these controllers. When we need to display peer-review, we just need to get the View Page Controller. It's an implementation of Facade Design Pattern.  

6. Give an example of the project, if you have collected the information you needed?  
Yes, when I was focusing on Expertiza System, which is an open-source peer-review system for NCSU students. We didn't expect the complication of the 3 layer hash data structure. When we need to display a single peer-review page, we need to call Review Controller, Score Controller, Question Controller, Feedback Controller, etc. We then wrote a new View Page Controller to connect all these controllers. When we need to display peer-review, we just need to get the View Page Controller. It's an implementation of Facade Design Pattern.


#####Company
4. Why Amazon?
Amazon is one of the most successful companies in the world. There are many intelligent software engineers. Working with them will make me happy.  
Another reason is AWS. I focused on Cloud Computing, Distributed System, High-Elastic backend development. Amazon is top 1 cloud service provider all over the world. It's amazing.  
I really eager to work in Amazon.  


Do you have some questions to ask?
Could you tell me something about the projects that you are working on? The size of the team. The language the team is using?
Can we take our pets to work space?
