 * 1.3 Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
 * Tips:
 * 1&2. Convert String to char array first, then quick sort the array, finally to judge the if two arrays are equal
 * 3. Use an int array to count the number of each char in two strings
 * <p/>
 * Time Complexity: 1&2. O(N*log(N))     3. O(N^2)
 * Space Complexity: 1&2&3. O(N)
