#### Max Heap
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/max-heap-in-java/

A max-heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is greater than or equal to the values in the children of that node.

Mapping the elements of a heap into an array is trivial: if a node is stored a index k, then its left child is stored at index 2k+1 and its right child at index 2k+2.

#### Min Heap

A Min-Heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is greater than or equal to the values in the children of that node.
Mapping the elements of a heap into an array is trivial: if a node is stored a index k, then its left child is stored at index 2k + 1 and its right child at index 2k + 2.



Top-K series code could be resolved by either heap or bucket sort.
